        <p></h2>Ingredients<h2>
            ½ teaspoon sesame oil
            
            1 tablespoon canola oil
            
            2 tablespoons chile paste
            
            2 cloves garlic, chopped
            
            4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch cubes
            
            ½ cup soy sauce
            
            1 onion, sliced lengthwise into eighths
            
            ½ medium head cabbage, coarsely chopped
            
            2 carrots, coarsely chopped
            
            8 ounces soba noodles, cooked and drained
            
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h3>step 1</h3>
            In a large skillet combine sesame oil, canola oil and chili paste; stir-fry 30 seconds. Add garlic and stir fry an additional 30 seconds. Add chicken and 1/4 cup of the soy sauce and stir fry until chicken is no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Remove mixture from pan, set aside, and keep warm.
            <h3>step 2</h3>
            In the emptied pan combine the onion, cabbage, and carrots. Stir-fry until cabbage begins to wilt, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the remaining soy sauce, cooked noodles, and the chicken mixture to pan and mix to blend. Serve and enjoy!</p>
